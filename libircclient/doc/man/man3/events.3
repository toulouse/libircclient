.PP
A most common event callback.
.PP
\fBParameters: \fP
.in +1c
.TP
\fB\fIsession\fP\fP
the session, which generates an event 
.TP
\fB\fIevent\fP\fP
the text name of the event. Useful in case you use a single  event handler for several events simultaneously.  
.TP
\fB\fIorigin\fP\fP
the originator of the event. See the note below. 
.TP
\fB\fIparams\fP\fP
a list of event params. Depending on the event nature, it  could have zero or more params. The actual number of params  is specified in count. None of the params can be NULL, but  'params' pointer itself could be NULL for some events. 
.TP
\fB\fIcount\fP\fP
the total number of params supplied.Every event generates a callback. This callback is generated by most events. Depending on the event nature, it can provide zero or more params. For each event, the number of provided params is fixed, and their meaning is  described.
.PP
Every event has origin, though the \fIorigin\fP variable may be NULL, which  means that event origin is unknown. The origin usually looks like  nick!host@ircserver, i.e. like tim!home@irc.krasnogorsk.ru. Such origins can not be used in IRC commands, and need to be stripped (i.e. host and  server part should be cut off) before using. This can be done either  explicitly, by calling \fBirc_target_get_nick()\fP, or implicitly for all the  events - by setting the \fBLIBIRC_OPTION_STRIPNICKS\fP option with \fBirc_option_set()\fP. 
.SS "typedef void(* irc_event_dcc_chat_t"
.PP
A remote DCC CHAT request callback.
.PP
\fBParameters: \fP
.in +1c
.TP
\fB\fIsession\fP\fP
the session, which generates an event 
.TP
\fB\fInick\fP\fP
the person who requested DCC CHAT with you. 
.TP
\fB\fIaddr\fP\fP
the person's IP address in decimal-dot notation. 
.TP
\fB\fIdccid\fP\fP
an id associated with this request. Use it in calls to  \fBirc_dcc_accept()\fP or \fBirc_dcc_decline()\fP.This callback is called when someone requests DCC CHAT with you. In respond you should call either \fBirc_dcc_accept()\fP to accept chat request, or  \fBirc_dcc_decline()\fP to decline chat request.

.TP
\fB\fInick\fP\fP

.TP
\fB\fIfilename\fP\fP
the sent filename. 
.TP
\fB\fIsize\fP\fP
the filename size. 
.TP
\fB\fIdccid\fP\fP
an id associated with this request. Use it in calls to  \fBirc_dcc_accept()\fP or \fBirc_dcc_decline()\fP.This callback is called when someone wants to send a file to you using  DCC SEND. As with chat, in respond you should call either \fBirc_dcc_accept()\fP  to accept this request and receive the file, or \fBirc_dcc_decline()\fP to  decline this request.

.PP
A numeric event callback.
.PP
\fBParameters: \fP
.in +1c
.TP
\fB\fIsession\fP\fP
the session, which generates an event 
.TP
\fB\fIevent\fP\fP
the numeric code of the event. Useful in case you use a  single event handler for several events simultaneously.  
.TP
\fB\fIorigin\fP\fP
the originator of the event. See the note below. 
.TP
\fB\fIparams\fP\fP
a list of event params. Depending on the event nature, it  could have zero or more params. The actual number of params  is specified in count. None of the params can be NULL, but  'params' pointer itself could be NULL for some events. 
.TP
\fB\fIcount\fP\fP
the total number of params supplied.Most times in reply to your actions the IRC server generates numeric  callbacks. Most of them are error codes, and some of them mark list start and list stop markers. Every code has its own set of params; for details you can either experiment, or read RFC 1459.
.PP
