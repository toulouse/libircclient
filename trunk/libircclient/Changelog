   * libircclient 0.2 released
   * select() timeout decreased to 0.25sec (was 1 sec). The reason: when
     the output buffer is empty, and server doesn't send anything, but a
     command was asynchronously added, it will be processed only after 
     select() timeout.
   * Fixed bug in DCC sessions - all DCC sessions requested by bots were
     terminated in 60 secs with TIMEOUT error.
